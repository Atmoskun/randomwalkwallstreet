Sprint 3 Plan

Date and duration: Nov 12 to Nov 19, one week

Sprint goal: transform our deployed prototype into a fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We will focus on implementing a complete, secure user journey. By the end of this sprint, a user should be able to sign up and run an analysis.

Selected user stories:
"As a user, I receive specific analysis that I want."	5	High
"As a developer, I have a clean requirements.txt file to speed up builds."	3	High
"As a developer, I have basic unit tests for the Analysis API."	3	Medium
"As a user, I see a warning if the ending quarter is later than the starting quarter."	5	High
Total story points: 16 points

Team member assignment: Alex Xu → front-end Peter Yang → backend Sarah Zhang → integration and testing

Identified risks: Testing external APIs is costly. We will figure out a way to avoid the costs.
