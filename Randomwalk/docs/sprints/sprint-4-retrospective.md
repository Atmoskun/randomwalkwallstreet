Sprint 4 Retrospective

Date: December 3, 2025
Attendees: Alex Xu, Peter Yang, Sarah Zhang

What went well?
1.  Seamless Production Deploy: Because we fixed the `requirements.txt` issues in Sprint 3, the Sprint 4 production deploy was incredibly smooth.
2.  A/B Test Insights: Implementing the analytics tracking was easier than expected using a simple Django middleware approach.
3.  Team Velocity: We maintained a consistent velocity (~19 points) throughout the project, which helped us predict our finish date accurately.

What didn't go well?
1.  Test Coverage Grind: Writing unit tests for the older code (Sprint 2 features) was tedious. Ideally, we should have written tests as we wrote the code.
2.  Time planning: We spent less time than ideal in the first half of this sprint. Ideally, the work should be spread evenly throughout the period.
 
What to improve? (Action Items)
1.  DevOps Priority: We learned that "DevOps is not optional." Setting up the CI/CD pipeline earlier would have saved time.
2.  Final Polish: Click through every link on Production to ensure no 404s before submission.
     Owner: All Team Members
     Deadline: Before Submission
