Sprint 4 Plan

Date and duration: December 3, 2025 (1 week)

Sprint Goal:
The final sprint focuses on hardening the application for public release. The goal is to deploy a stable Production Environment, implement the mandatory A/B Testing Infrastructure to gather user data, and finalize all documentation and code quality checks for the final submission.

Team Capacity:
Time Commitment: 5-6 hours/week per member.
 Roles:
Alex/Peter: A/B test UI and Analytics.
Sarah/Peter: Production Render environment setup.
All Members: Final README, code reviews, and test coverage.

Selected User Stories:

| Issue | Title | Story Points | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| #1 | A/B Test Endpoint | 5 | Critical | As a product owner, I want to run an A/B test on a public endpoint to see which button text performs better. |
| #2 | Production Deployment | 5 | Critical | As a developer, I need a separate Production environment so I don't break the live app while testing. |
| #3 | Code Quality | 5 | High | As a developer, I need the codebase to pass linting and have >50% test coverage. |
Total committed story points: 15 points 

Dependencies and Risks:
Dependency: The A/B test requires a specific SHA1 hash of our team nickname (patient-sky).
Risk: Ad-blockers might skew our A/B test analytics data.
