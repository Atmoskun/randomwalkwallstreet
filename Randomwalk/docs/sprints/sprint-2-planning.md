Sprint 2 Plan

Sprint goal: Get a working web app that can take a ticker and quarter range, run analysis, and return basic insights.

Stories:
  Build front-end for ticker and quarter selection (3 pts)
  Create backend API to run analysis (5 pts)
  Connect front-end to backend (5 pts)
  Show output on screen (3 pts)
  
Total committed story points: 16 pts

Team member assignment:
Alex Xu → front-end
Peter Yang → backend
Sarah Zhang → integration and testing

Identified risks:
LLM API limits access; Long files may cause slow responses.
