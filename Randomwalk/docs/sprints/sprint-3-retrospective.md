Sprint 3 Retrospective

Date: Nov 19, 2025 Attendees: Alex Xu, Peter Yang, Sarah Zhang

What went well?
1.	Velocity Stability: The team is settling into a rhythm.
2.	Requirement Doc: We have requirements.txt that is easy to read.
3.	Auth Flow: The login page works seamlessly with the analysis page.

What didn't go well?
1.	Test Configuration: Setting up tests to run on Render was difficult, so we are currently only running tests locally.
2.	Styling Inconsistencies: The styles of the login page and the analysis page are not quite similar.

Team Dynamics Reflection
The team is working well together. Communication regarding git merges has improved since Sprint 2. We are now reviewing each other's PRs more consistently before merging to main.

What to improve? (Action Items)
1.	Consistent Look and Feel: The website looks a bit mismatched. We need a simple guide for colors and buttons so everything matches.
Owner: Alex, Peter
Deadline: Sprint 4
2.	Automatic Testing: Running tests by hand is tedious. We should set up GitHub to run our tests automatically whenever we push code.
Owner: All Team Members
Deadline: Sprint 4
3.	Fix Date Selection Bug: Right now, users can pick a "Start Date" that is after the "End Date." We need to block that.
Owner: Peter
Deadline: Sprint 4
