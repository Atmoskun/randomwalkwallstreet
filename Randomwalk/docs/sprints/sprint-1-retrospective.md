Sprint 1 Retrospective

Date: Nov 5, 2025

Attendees: Alex Xu, Sarah Zhang, Peter Yang

What went well?
1.  Role Definition: We successfully assigned roles (Scrum Master rotates, Alex as PO Proxy).
2.  Tool Setup: We established GitHub for version control and defined our "Definition of Done" and "Definition of Ready".
3.  Vision Alignment: We aligned on the MVP scope (Upload/Store + Quarter-aware selection).

What didn't go well?
1.  Scope Management: We had to cut "peer comparison" and "quantitative KPI extraction" to post-MVP to stay realistic.
2.  Scheduling: Coordinating the 3 hours of joint work time was challenging initially.

What to improve? (Action Items)
1.  Code Review Standards: Code reviews must be completed within three days.
     Owner: All Team Members
     Deadline: Ongoing
2.  Conflict Resolution: We agreed to talk directly and respectfully, using the Scrum Master to mediate if needed.
     Owner: All Team Members
     Deadline: Ongoing
